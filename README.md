# GAS_Template
A template project for my GAS implementation

This is still a work in progress template that I have started recently. 

The idea behind this template is to have a sample project that can be integrated as a base project for others to use for a game that uses a stat based system (FFX or any RPG like game)

So far the only things that have been implemented right now are the c++ side of the effects and abilities getting applied to the base character class, the blueprints applying the effects and the start of the stats system in c++
